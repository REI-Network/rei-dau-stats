## Technical Implementation

### Data Retrieval Strategy

1. **Worker Process Architecture**: Scheduled processing runs in separate worker process
2. **Non-blocking Operations**: Main Express server remains responsive during data processing
3. **Incremental Updates**: Only process new blocks since last run
4. **Record-based Storage**: Generate one record every 1200 blocks (1 hour)
5. **24-hour Aggregation**: Merge last 24 records for 24-hour statistics
6. **Data Retention**: Automatically clean up data older than 7 days
7. **Parallel Retrieval**: Use Promise.all to retrieve block data in parallel
8. **Address Deduplication**: Use Set data structure to ensure address uniqueness
9. **Persistent Cache**: File-based caching for fast API responses

### Performance Optimizations

- **Worker Process**: Data processing runs in separate process, not blocking main server
- **Cached Responses**: API returns instantly from cache
- **Incremental Processing**: Only process new blocks, not entire history
- **Batch Processing**: Process blocks in configurable batches
- **Parallel Requests**: Concurrent block data retrieval
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and retry mechanisms
- **Memory Optimization**: Efficient address deduplication and storage
- **Process Isolation**: Worker crashes don't affect main server

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable Name | Default Value             | Description              |
| ------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `REI_RPC_URL` | `https://rpc.rei.network` | REI Network RPC endpoint |
| `PORT`        | `3000`                    | Server port              |

### Custom RPC Endpoint

If you need to use a different REI Network RPC endpoint, modify the `REI_RPC_URL` variable in the `.env` file.

## Usage Examples

### Using curl to Get Data

```bash
# Get 24-hour statistics
curl http://localhost:3000/api/stats/24h

# Health check
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

### Using JavaScript to Get Data

```javascript
const axios = require('axios');

async function getStats() {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get('http://localhost:3000/api/stats/24h');
    console.log('24-hour statistics:', response.data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to retrieve data:', error.message);
  }
}

getStats();
```

## Important Notes

1. **Network Connection**: Ensure the server can access the REI Network RPC endpoint
2. **Data Accuracy**: Statistics are based on block timestamps and may have slight time deviations
3. **Cache Directory**: The service creates a `cache/` directory for storing statistics data
4. **Worker Process**: Statistics are updated automatically every 30 minutes via worker process
5. **Non-blocking**: Main server remains responsive during data processing
6. **Record-based Storage**: One record is generated every 1200 blocks (1 hour) for efficient storage
7. **24-hour Aggregation**: 24-hour statistics are calculated by merging the last 24 records
8. **Smart Startup**: First run processes only 6 hours of recent data for quick startup
9. **Data Retention**: Historical data older than 7 days is automatically cleaned up
10. **Incremental Updates**: Only new blocks are processed, making the service very efficient
11. **Error Handling**: The service includes comprehensive error handling and returns detailed error messages
12. **Data Persistence**: Statistics are cached to disk and survive server restarts
13. **Process Isolation**: Worker process crashes don't affect the main server

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Connection Timeout**: Check network connectivity and RPC endpoint availability
2. **Inaccurate Data**: Verify the data format returned by the RPC endpoint
3. **Insufficient Memory**: For large datasets, consider increasing server memory or optimizing batch size

### Log Monitoring

The service outputs detailed log information during operation, including:

- Block processing progress
- Cache operations
- Scheduled task execution
- Error messages
- Performance statistics

### Cache Management

The service automatically manages cache files:

- `cache/statistics.json`: Current 24-hour statistics
- `cache/history.json`: Historical processing data
- Cache files are created automatically on first run
- Cache is updated incrementally with each scheduled task
- No manual cache management required

### Worker Process Architecture

The service uses a worker process architecture for optimal performance:

#### Main Process (server.js)

- Runs the Express API server
- Handles HTTP requests and responses
- Manages worker process lifecycle
- Loads and serves cached statistics

#### Worker Process (worker.js)

- Runs scheduled data processing tasks
- Handles heavy computational work (block processing)
- Communicates with main process via IPC
- Can be run independently for testing

#### Benefits

- **Non-blocking**: Main server remains responsive during data processing
- **Isolation**: Worker crashes don't affect the main server
- **Scalability**: Can easily add more worker processes if needed
- **Testing**: Worker can be tested independently

#### Process Communication

- Main process sends `run_task` messages to worker
- Worker sends `task_completed` or `task_error` messages back
- All communication is asynchronous and non-blocking
